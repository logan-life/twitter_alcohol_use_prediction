# Abstract

Inspired by work done at the [World Well-Being Project](https://www.wwbp.org/), we investigate the correlation between Twitter language usage and excessive alcohol consumption rates. We replicate a study by [Curtis et al.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194290) using updated county tweet data. We successfully replicate the published baseline results as well as extensions to this baseline. We demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between the Twitter data features and drinking, stronger even than the socioeconomic and demographic features typically used to predict excessive alcohol consumption rates.
