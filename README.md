# Abstract

Inspired by work done at the World Well-Being Project, we investigate the correlation between Twitter language usage and excessive alcohol consumption rates. We replicate a study by Curtis et al. using updated county tweet data. We successfully replicate the published baseline results as well as extensions to this baseline. We demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between the Twitter data features and drinking, stronger even than the socioeconomic and demographic features typically used to predict excessive alcohol consumption rates.
